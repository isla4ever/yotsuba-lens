# Contributing

Yotsuba Lens accepts focused fixes and features that preserve its local-first,
evidence-based capture model. Open an issue before large architecture or product
changes so the scope and privacy boundary can be agreed first.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 22.13.0 or newer
- npm 10 or newer
- Chrome or another Chromium browser

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run dev:collector` only when testing an authorized feature that needs
Chrome DevTools Protocol access. The standard build must never request the
`debugger` permission.

## Required Checks

```bash
npm run audit:dependencies
npm run check:all
npx playwright install chromium
npm run check:browser
npm run package:store
```

`check:browser` exercises ordinary and 100,000-node pages. A capture change is
not ready if it loses heartbeat interactions, exceeds the task budget, keeps
sampling after stop, fails to restore page state, or emits browser errors.

## Pull Requests

- Keep each pull request to one reviewable product or engineering outcome.
- Add behavior-focused tests for fixes and protocol changes.
- Include narrow and wide screenshots for visible UI changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible behavior.
- Do not commit captured website data, credentials, generated `.output/`,
  `dist/`, or `output/` artifacts.
- Do not add automatic click, input, submission, or unknown navigation behavior
  without an explicit product and privacy review.
