[中文](README.md) | **English**

Yotsuba Lens is an **evidence-first** Chrome extension for AI coding, vibe coding, and frontend reconstruction workflows. Instead of summarizing a screenshot, it translates a live page into visual tokens, layout structure, component grammar, interaction timelines, motion evidence, implementation clues, and acceptance rules.

```text
Live page → Smart Capture → Structured evidence → Explicit gaps → Prompt / Rebuild draft → Scene acceptance
```

It is not a source downloader, and it never turns missing states into a claim of complete reproduction. The rule is simple: **describe what the evidence supports and keep everything else as an explicit gap.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Yotsuba Lens is currently alpha software installed through Chrome Developer Mode. Use it only on pages you are authorized to analyze, reference, or rebuild.

## Highlights

| Highlight | How Yotsuba Lens handles it |
| --- | --- |
| **One action for baseline capture** | Smart Capture shares a 15-second budget across preflight indexing, stabilization, and passive observation. Rebuild screenshot and CDP finalization use separate timeouts and circuit breakers, while large or continuously mutating pages degrade safely. |
| **Full Side Panel by default** | Clicking the extension action opens the Side Panel, where mode, capture, coverage, history, and settings share one workspace. For quick actions, the Side Panel opens the native toolbar-anchored extension popup instead of a separate window. |
| **Reference and Rebuild are separate modes** | Reference extracts transferable design language. Rebuild preserves real screenshots, scenes, geometry, and acceptance constraints. The product never conflates inspiration with reproduction. |
| **Capture only what is missing** | Evidence health produces at most three scroll, hover, focus, open, or responsive tasks instead of making users manually record the entire page first. |
| **Capture-to-acceptance workflow** | Rebuild Packs carry scene manifests and acceptance rules for screenshot, pixel, geometry, motion-checkpoint, and browser-error checks. |
| **No synthetic page actions** | The extension does not automatically click, type, submit forms, or navigate. Users perform real supplemental actions while Yotsuba Lens observes and saves the requested state. |
| **On-demand injection and split permissions** | The page bridge is injected only after a user action. The standard build excludes `debugger`; deeper CDP collection is isolated in the Collector build. |

## More Than Screenshot-To-Prompt

| Dimension | Typical screenshot workflow | Yotsuba Lens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | One or several static screenshots | DOM structure, tokens, geometry, screenshots, events, motion, and runtime clues |
| Interaction states | Described manually or guessed by a model | Real hover, focus, scroll, open, and responsive scene evidence |
| Missing information | Often filled in as an imagined result | Recorded explicitly as `missing`, `partial`, or `not-applicable` |
| Output | One generic prompt | Evidence Pack, AI Prompt Pack, or Rebuild Draft Pack |
| Acceptance | Visual judgment alone | Explainable candidate reports based only on captured scenes |

## Product Preview

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Extension popup</strong><br />Keeps only mode, Smart Capture, component picking, manual capture, and export; detailed briefs live in the Side Panel.</td>
    <td><strong>Reference workspace</strong><br />Centralizes evidence, export, and generated follow-up tasks without duplicate actions.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 2. Rebuild Coverage And Multi-Route Projects

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/design-lens-sidepanel-coverage.png" alt="Yotsuba Lens Rebuild coverage, technical clues, and route project" width="768" />
</p>

Rebuild does not hide uncertainty behind a single completion score. Structure, style, state, screenshot, responsive, and Canvas evidence are reported separately; technical signals and Recorder stay collapsed until needed. A project can contain up to eight same-origin routes for per-route verification.

  <tr>
    <td><strong>One clear task at a time</strong><br />The Side Panel explains the current gap and the next user action.</td>
    <td><strong>Observe only the target state</strong><br />A real hover, scroll, or open action is saved after it stabilizes, without synthetic clicks.</td>

  </p>
  <p>Yotsuba Lens can import sanitized Chrome DevTools Recorder JSON. It does not automatically replay the flow. Steps are matched against existing screenshot evidence, and unresolved scenes are merged into at most three supplemental tasks.</p>

## Two Work Modes

| Mode | Best for | Output boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Reference** | Borrowing visual, layout, motion, or interaction ideas to create an original interface | Extract transferable design grammar without treating the reference brand, content, or assets as the target product |
| **Rebuild** | Creating a verifiable implementation draft under explicit authorization | Be accountable only for captured screenshots and scenes; uncaptured states remain gaps and are never presented as high fidelity |

## Workflow

1. **Open a page**: visit a normal `http` or `https` page and click Yotsuba Lens; the Side Panel opens by default.
2. **Choose the outcome**: use Reference for original design direction or Rebuild for an authorized implementation draft.
3. **Run Smart Capture**: collect baseline evidence; the page bridge is injected on demand only after this kind of user action.
4. **Review gaps**: use the Side Panel and complete guided capture only for important missing states.
5. **Organize the project**: import a Recorder plan or add up to eight same-origin routes to a Rebuild project.
6. **Export and build**: hand the evidence or prompt pack to an AI coding agent.
7. **Verify the candidate**: replay only evidenced Rebuild scenes without inventing uncaptured behavior.

## Output Packs

| Pack | Main files | Use it for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Evidence-only Pack** | `README.md`, `skill.md`, `evidence.json` | Saving, sharing, or handing structured design evidence to any AI tool |
| **AI Prompt Pack** | Evidence files, `ai-coding-prompt.md`, `ai-implementation-brief.md` | Generating a target-specific coding prompt with an OpenAI-compatible model |
| **Rebuild Draft Pack** | `capture-project-v2.json`, `scene-manifest.json`, `acceptance.json`, screenshots, and bounded artifacts | Preserving authorized baselines, explicit gaps, and candidate acceptance rules |

## Install

Requirements: Node.js `>=22.13.0`, npm `>=10`, and Chrome or another Chromium browser.

### Standard Build

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, choose **Load unpacked**, and select:

```text
<project-root>/.output/chrome-mv3
```

The standard build does not request Chrome's `debugger` permission. Use it for everyday Reference and baseline Rebuild capture.

### Collector Build

```bash
npm run build:collector
```

Load `<project-root>/.output/collector/chrome-mv3`. Collector adds `debugger` for authorized DOMSnapshot, matched CSS, geometry, viewport, and animation evidence. Canvas bitmap capture is off by default and bounded by count, pixel-area, and file-size budgets.

## Rebuild Candidate Acceptance

```bash
npm run verify:rebuild -- \
  --pack <rebuild-pack.zip> \
  --url http://localhost:3000
```

The verifier replays only initial, scroll, hover, focus, and open states supported by `scene-manifest.json`. It produces JSON/HTML reports, candidate screenshots, diffs, and focused repair context for an agent.

See the [AstroWind reconstruction benchmark](docs/astrowind-rebuild-benchmark.md) and the [Bilibili homepage capture and reconstruction benchmark](docs/bilibili-rebuild-benchmark.md) for real capture, candidate, and error measurements. Both reports keep failed cases visible; the Bilibili case also exercises recovery on a high-mutation page and stable-node acceptance.

## Privacy And Permissions

Yotsuba Lens processes and exports evidence locally by default. It sends a reduced evidence payload only when a user configures a model key and explicitly requests AI output. That payload is designed to exclude raw DOM, cookies, local storage, credentials, screenshots, and unmasked input values.

| Permission | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `activeTab`, `scripting` | Inject the page bridge and capture the active page after a user action |
| `storage` | Store locale, theme, workspace metadata, and optional AI settings locally |
| `tabs`, `sidePanel` | Identify the active tab and connect it to the persistent workspace |
| `<all_urls>` | Let users initiate capture across sites; it does not mean the extension runs automatically on every page |
| `debugger` | Included only in Collector for explicitly authorized, bounded deep collection |

Local Rebuild packs may contain visible page text, screenshots, and sanitized DOMSnapshot data. Treat them as potentially sensitive files. See [Privacy And Permissions](docs/privacy.md) for the complete boundary.

## Development And Quality Gates

```bash
npm run dev                 # Standard development server
npm run dev:collector       # Collector development server
npm run check:all           # TypeScript, 101 tests, and both production builds
npm run check:browser       # Real MV3 injection, UI alignment/overflow, and 20k/100k DOM recovery probes
npm run package:store       # Validate and create store candidate ZIPs and SHA256SUMS
```

Install Chromium before the first browser gate:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```
